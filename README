The webtest-quickstart project is a sample project that can be used to quickly get started writing Selenium test cases
in JUnit.  It includes samples for running tests locally and remotely, and sample maven profiles for driving tests
using different browser types and combinations.

A more complete introduction is included in the javadocs, here:
